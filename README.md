Live version may be viewed [here](http://ibec-eats-autocomplete.dustinjones.site/).

To install, copy directory and files to your serving directory, and enter a google API key at the top of index.php.  That's it!

This is pretty much the same thing as ibec-eats, except the search input is an Autocomplete widget instead of a SearchBox; both have different behavior.
